# R3-Training-Task-2-Software-
R3 Maze Project

Downloaded python3.9 for windows, then downloaded pygame package.

Wacthed videos about random maze generation using Python. Then I reseacrhed more about the recursive backtracker algorithm. After understanding the algorithm I started to implement it into my code.

Worked on my code and resolved any issues with some more research. Finally was able to finish with a small error which does not affect my program during its runtime. Did not have enough time to fix this error so I just left it as is, since it does not affect the runtime.
